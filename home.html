        <p>The forms of art are diverse, ranging from traditional media such as painting, drawing, and sculpture, to forms like prints, photographs, videos, web-based works, data, installations, or architectural structures. Art can even exist in forms that are not physical, such as performances, language, or thoughts. Depending on the form a work takes, some persist indefinitely, while others exist only briefly for a few individuals. Some may exist momentarily but continue to exist as they circulate through people's mouths, sometimes transforming into different forms of existence.
