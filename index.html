          <h2>2. To another Space</h2>
          <p> The forms of art are diverse, ranging from traditional media such as painting, drawing, and sculpture, to forms like prints, photographs, videos, web-based works, data, installations, or architectural structures. Art can even exist in forms that are not physical, such as performances, language, or thoughts. Depending on the form a work takes, some persist indefinitely, while others exist only briefly for a few individuals. Some may exist momentarily but continue to exist as they circulate through people's mouths, sometimes transforming into different forms of existence.

          Artworks are desired to persist in any way possible, which is why they are transformed. They become a more useful form and are shared to remember the appearance of the work, to show it to those who haven't seen it in person, or to secure funding. Digitization serves as the most useful method for this purpose.  Particularly for forms like performances that don't have a fixed physical presence, transforming them in digital media is crucial. After exhibitions or events, efforts are made to document them as much as possible, often in the form of videos or photographs. Sometimes, nothing remains except for photographs. I feel like the final form of the artwork might be a JPEG.

          The body that constitutes physical works is made up of various materials, requiring artists to study materials extensively, particularly in traditional media. They study primarily which materials or methods can sustain a work of art for a long time. As time passes, artworks naturally deteriorate and lose their form, making the durability of materials essential for maintaining the artwork's shape.

Most works are deconstructed by the artist's hands before the materials reach the end of their lifespan. For young writers, determining whether it is worth maintaining the form of their work is more important than the material itself.

          Artworks are not human, but they exist within human values and systems. Physical works, in particular, face real-world values and institutions as they exist within physical spaces, requiring space and incurring costs accordingly. They’re constantly evaluated as to whether they can maintain their form and whether they have the worth to occupy a certain space. If an artwork has a survival instinct, it might prefer to extend its life more comfortably through a digital body and space. This would be more efficient for the work, and beneficial for the artist.

          <h3>3. Digital Space </h3>   
            <p>Before moving into the digital space, I'd like to briefly discuss events that occurred during the three-year period of the COVID-19 pandemic starting from 2020. While this perspective may be subjective, it's a fact that during this time, there was an explosive emergence of exhibitions worldwide incorporating new digital technologies such as VR alongside the digitization of artworks.

              When the pandemic suddenly struck and physical contact became impossible,  people began to view the digital space as an alternative to physical spaces. This led not only to interpersonal interactions but also to encounters between individuals and artworks occurring in digital spaces. As a result, the immigratation(digitization) of artworks and spaces began.
              
              Museums and galleries swiftly adopted a method of installing artworks in real spaces and scanning both the artwork and the space together to render them in digital spaces. These digital exhibitions appeared neutral and new due to their high-resolution images and cutting-edge technology.In particular, public institutions like art museums produced VR exhibitions as if they were churned out in factories, in order to exhaust the allocated budgets.
              
              While these digital exhibitions had no constraints of time and space, viewers could only click to navigate and view the exhibitions at designated points in time. The movements of the viewers were perfectly controlled, and accordingly, the viewpoints and images of the artworks were uniformly controlled. Models implemented like in <u><a href="#f1" id="ref1">Figure 1</a></u> resulted in strange "dollhouses"(there is actually a View Dollhouse mode) where the outer walls disappeared, leaving only the inner walls and artworks. Exhibitions scanned and rendered in 3D space were as silent and lifeless. with no one alive within. The space and the artworks within were literally preserved and specimenized. At least I couldn't appreciate this digital technology exhibition.

              Of course, there were many attempts to incorporate various forms, such as games, and to showcase a variety of technologies in exhibitions as well. However, it didn't resonate with me significantly, and I found myself pondering quite a bit about exhibitions where I couldn't appreciate the artwork. Is this phenomenon, especially VR exhibitions of the same format, derived from the way how institutions such as museums and galleries treat artworks? From critical thoughts on whether the essence of the criticized white cube <sup><a href="#b1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> has resurfaced amid a national disaster to simply considering temporary issues arising from rapidly changing circumstances, various thoughts have arisen. However, I didn't intend to attribute any phenomenon to a single cause. 

              
              During the COVID-19 period when physical contact became impossible, we embraced the digital space as an alternative to physical spaces, not only for face-to-face interactions between people but also for interactions between people and artworks.

          However, the approach most art institutions such as museums and galleries chose was to install exhibitions and scan the entire space to render them in the digital realm. These digital exhibitions were rendered with high-resolution images and state-of-the-art technology, making them appear objective and neutral. 

          While these digital exhibitions had no constraints of time and space, viewers could only click to navigate and view the exhibitions at designated points in time. The movements of the viewers were perfectly controlled, and accordingly, the viewpoints and images of the artworks were uniformly controlled. Models implemented like in  resulted in strange "dollhouses"(there is actually a View Dollhouse mode) where the outer walls disappeared, leaving only the inner walls and artworks. Exhibitions scanned and rendered in 3D space were as silent and lifeless. with no one alive within. The space and the artworks within were literally preserved and specimenized.

            Digital space is a virtual environment where digital systems, networks, servers, databases, etc. However, it is based on real physical structures(Figure 2) such as servers, data centers, and internet infrastructure. This physical structure supports and operates digital services and environments. Similar to purchasing real space in cubic meters or square feet, one should purchase digital space in bytes. Digital space prices are generally more affordable than acquiring or maintaining physical space. However, digital space has its limitations and is not infinitely abundant. What forms do works take in digital spaces? And what values and systems are involved in that process?

          <div class="box1" id="4">
          <h4>4. Digital Image processing : Compression - The way of thinking</h4>       
            <p>Returning to the original topic, what process does artwork undergo to enter the digital space? First, Physical artworks are digitized to enter the digital space. Digitization refers to the process of converting artworks into a format usable on computers or digital devices. To digitize, artworks are photographed or scanned with high-resolution cameras, converting them into digital images. These digital images are then transformed into data using binary code, consisting of 0s and 1s, so that computers can understand them. 
              
              And the data is in a specific file format for compatibility with the system. Broadly, they are divided into Raster and Vector methods. The format of an image file is also associated with its size. Due to the high capacity of digital images, digital files are compressed using specific methods due to transmission speed and storage costs. There are two main methods for compressing images: lossless and lossy compression. Believe it or not, our eyes and ears aren't that great, so we usually don't notice missing parts here and there. Lossy compression works by removing less important information to be more efficient, making it the preferred method in many cases.
              
              The compression technology used in digitalization, especially in image processing, refers to methods for efficiently storing or transmitting image data. As a result, these strategies play an important role in managing and transmitting image data, typically involving processes to remove redundancy or reduce unnecessary information to minimize data size. For example, the representative lossy compression format, JPEG, undergoes multiple compression processes, during which the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) table (Figure 3) is utilized. Therefore, when enlarging the image, one can observe that it consists of certain patterns.Compression technologies vary depending on the format, but generally, they involve a compression process and are formatted accordingly.
              (Figure3 - Pattern table for JPEG. )
              
              Rather than delving deeper into compression technology, interestingly, these compression strategies have also been utilized in socio-economic aspects. Adopted as an economic development approach in East Asia between the 1960s and 1970s, this strategy aimed to minimize unnecessary elements and maximize efficiency, called as Compressed Development. This approach had various impacts on the socio-economic culture during the industrialization process and continues to provoke much discussion today.
              (Figure 4 - Apartments in South Korea)
              
              Especially significant is that this compression strategy can also be found in modern society's logistics technology, known as logistics, which emerged alongside the discourse of globalization in the 1970s, originating from military logistics that dealt with the deployment and supply of armies during wars. During this period of global economic expansion (globalization), companies sought to maintain competitiveness through innovative strategies to prevent a decline in profitability in the logistics industry. To achieve this, they introduced technologies and systems that shortened both time and space, essentially compressing them, in order to reduce costs and increase efficiency. In other words, they shortened the cycle of production-distribution-consumption of goods, compressing the spatial barriers of distribution and consumption (compression of time and space). Now, all economic activities operated by capital have emerged with the reduction of the circulation time of goods through the compression of time and space as an important issue. As a result, the supply chain of goods (logistics) has emerged as a way to maximize capital profits.
              
              Deborah Cowen argues that logistics is not simply about logistical technology, but rather a complex intertwining of logistics and military logistics, which she describes as political and military acts. Consequently, she discusses the violence and power structures associated with global trade on a worldwide scale.
              
              The reason for expanding the discussion of compression strategies in image processing technology to socio-economic contexts is to address the inherent value systems and perspectives embedded in compression technology. Furthermore, these technologies are closely associated with our values, perspectives, and impacts. Compression techniques operate by maximizing efficiency and removing unnecessary elements, discerning between what is necessary and unnecessary, and integrating them accordingly. This judgment inherently reflects a prioritization of economic efficiency, aiming to maximize capital profit. Approaching this technology from a political perspective makes it difficult for us to simply see this compression technique as just image processing. However, we need to think about how we view and understand these technologies.
              
              One important consideration is that such an examination does not aim simply to determine right from wrong. However, as mentioned earlier (2. Digital Space), just as the digital space exists atop the values and institutions of reality, image processing technologies within the digital realm also not only reflect the values and institutions of reality but also influence them. They are intricately intertwined, sharing a collectively embedded purpose. And sometimes, rather than being independent and neutral, technology exists as a means. In other words, we need to understand that technological changes interact with social structures and values in multifaceted ways, whether for better or worse.

            <h5>5. Digital Image Composition: Pixel - The way of seeing</h5>   
            <p> Entering the digital space, as artworks undergo image processing and assume a specific format, they become image data files and are displayed to us through a medium called a display when needed. Breaking down the display into smaller units, it is based on pixels, and the minimum unit of digital images is also composed of pixels (Picture Element). Displays mostly have a square shape, and we perceive pixels as small squares. Consequently, we recognize digital images as collections of square pixels. So, when did pixel technology start adopting a square shape?
              
              Below (Figure 7) is the first digital image. The first digital photograph was taken around 1957, about 20 years before the invention of the first commercial digital camera. In the photo, you can see a pattern resembling square pixels, marking the initial application of the concept of pixels in digital images. Russell Kirsch, a scientist, pondered the question of "What if computers could see the world the way we do?" Consequently, this black-and-white baby picture not only represented how computers perceive the world but also altered our way of seeing the world.
              (Figure 7 - Pioneering digitally scanned image of Russell Kirsch's son Walden, 1957) 
              
              Partially thanks to Kirsch, square pixels became the standard, and the boundaries of the world became a bit rougher. Russell argues that the reason for applying square-shaped pixels was logical, namely, square-shaped pixels operate efficiently in image processing and computer calculations. Square pixels represent images in a grid format, making it easy to store and process the color, brightness, and other attributes of each pixel. This structure is effective for mathematical image processing and allows for the easy application of various image processing techniques and algorithms. However, with the current advancement in image processing technology and computers, there's no longer a need to insist on square shapes. Nonetheless, we still live in a world of square pixels. Interestingly, after half a century, Kirsch apologized for introducing the cursed square pixel into our lives and returned to fix all the jagged edges.
              
              He diverged from square pixels and explored ancient mosaic techniques from Italy dating back 1500 years, in order to apply new methods. He realized that Italian artists analyzed images before creating mosaics. They then chose the best tesserae (predecessors of pixels), based on shape, color, and size, to create the finest mosaic. He applied this approach to create images composed of various polygon shapes, instead of fixing the shape of pixels according to the image (Figure 8).
              [Figure 8 -From the suqare pixelated system (left) to the image with new image processing technology applied (right)]
              
              
              Like Russell was influenced by ancient mosaics, delving further into the past reveals that the concept of pixels itself originated from 19th-century paintings. If we zoom in on a painting by Georges Seurat, the founder of Pointillism (Figure 9), we see that it is composed of countless points, akin to pixels, but they don't have a specific shape; they are more like small dots. Thus, the conventional concept of "pixels" wasn't small squares; rather, "pixels" were closer to point samples, or dots, in the image. Therefore, they were dimensionless and had no inherent specific shape. This concept of "pixels" was developed before widely used technologies like fixed displays such as LCDs became prevalent. However, due to Russell's digital image and display technology, pixels took on a square shape. As a result, this pixelation sliced the original image into square forms. This square pixel technology became the way computers see the world, and beyond that, it also changed how we perceive the world, not just images.

            <p>6. Digital Image Body : Display - The way of existence

              The artwork, or rather, the image of the work (it is more appropriate to call it the image of the work, but I will use both interchangeably), goes through the process of formatting and compression, and is roughly broken down into square pixels, ultimately becoming efficiently optimized for the digital space. And the work, having lost its fixed form, is presented to us through the display. Then, can we say that the display is the body of the digitized artwork image? In the past, traditionally, images were applied onto specific physical materials such as paper, canvas, or walls, and had a fixed form. However, today's displays cannot be considered the fixed physical form, or body, of the image, as images are commonly perceived. Rather, they function as temporary mediums or structures that the image briefly resides on. This signifies freedom from fixation, but also implies constant wandering. This could be a discussion about the nature of existence.
              
              In other words, the digitization and movement of artworks or their images within displays signify a change in their form and mode of existence. This transformation is not only about the existence of digital images but also, as mentioned earlier, is associated with social perceptions and perspectives. Discussions on such fluid modes of existence are intertwined with various socio-economic fields like nomadism and logistics, as mentioned in the previous text. The phrase "At some point, the world seems to be flowing along migration routes rather than staying fixed, valuing variability over stability, and flexibility over rigidity" eloquently depicts these changes. I believe that the fluidity and variability within displays have also influenced production methods, which I aim to explore further in the next text (6. Appendix: AI and Logistics).
              
              Returning to the discussion of displays, despite these changes, displays traditionally share a visual commonality with paintings. The screen on a display is essentially a flat rectangular surface with a frame, serving as a window that exists within the space our bodies inhabit while also leading to another space. Traditionally, everything outside the screen frame is filtered, selected, replaced, or treated as non-existent, a phenomenon that has evolved with the advent of smaller screens like TVs and computer monitors following the movie screen. Originally developed for military purposes to efficiently process and display information collected by radars, computer screens present multiple coexisting windows rather than just one screen. Therefore, while we sometimes view a single artwork image on the screen, we often see overlapping images, text, and other elements. This demonstrates that images do not exist as singular entities but rather coexist with other elements.
              
              As technology advances, screens have indeed begun to disappear entirely with the invention of VR technology, as Leif Manovich suggested. However, displays are increasingly becoming either immensely larger like walls or lightweight enough to be portable, narrowing the distance between them and our eyes and enveloping us more closely. How will images exist in the future? And how will the way images exist be intertwined with the way we exist in our lives? That's a point worth considering for the future.

          <div class="box1" id="7">
            <p>6. Appendix:  Ai and Logistics - Supply Chain Technology

            I think perhaps one of the most promising and rapidly evolving fields that showcases how images are processed and composed in the digital realm is likely the field of AI. Personally, I view image generators powered by AI technology not so much as image creation tools, but rather as technologies that supply products, closely related to logistics.

            As mentioned earlier, before the 1970s, supply was managed independently across the domains of production, distribution, and consumption. However, logistics compressed and integrated these segmented areas. In other words, it efficiently supplied raw materials and parts during the production stage and established and managed distribution networks to deliver finished products to the end consumers. Through this, logistics maintained a smooth flow between production and consumption, ensuring that products reached the appropriate locations in a timely manner. Essentially, logistics acted as a technology linking production and consumption directly.

            Current AI technologies applied in Image Generators like DALL·E, Midjoruney, and Stable diffusion automatically produce images in response to text and tailor them to user demands, offering users the ability to select and consume desired images much like products. Process-wise, these technologies compress the production, distribution, and consumption of images into one, akin to logistics, directly linking production and consumption. Rather than solely producing images, It looks like they provide a supply chain within systematically data-ized images to deliver desired images to users. AI-driven image generation technologies effectively connect the production and consumption of data.

            What was mentioned earlier about logistics is that it prioritizes supply chain networks and provides rights and powerful means to suppress any disruptions to the supply chain, using the logic of security to maintain it. Another aspect to highlight is how logistics operates to regulate workers and suppress political rights in the name of efficiency in product circulation. For instance, cities like Dubai, structured as hubs for logistics, focus on restructuring urban spaces to optimize transportation for private enterprises and maximize logistics efficiency. These cities predominantly employ foreign workers, often in temporary employment status without citizenship rights. Furthermore, they are denied basic labor rights such as collective bargaining and strikes, and face expulsion if engaging in political activities. Continuously surveilled under the pretext of security, their actions are regulated and controlled to optimize product circulation, reducing them to mere cogs in the flow of goods, quantified and data-ized.

            This flow can also be found in AI. AI indiscriminately digitizes and acquires all information on the internet. And when it comes to rights, it raises issues like copyright for digital works of art or texts by authors, turning all rights and information into adjuncts of the flow aimed at indiscriminately providing them to users. As a result, we need to consider whether AI-generated image creation technology is actually creating images or providing such a cyclical structure. Furthermore, like JPEG creating approximations of images, within this supply chain, Chat GPT does everything integrated and processed to provide us with only approximations of blurry data, prompting us to consider the necessity of thinking about it.

          <p> <sup>1</sup> The reason for reflecting on criticism of the art institution is that during this period, the role and fairness of art institutions, particularly art museums, have once again become prominent. As mentioned earlier, during the pandemic period, museums abruptly embraced online platforms. Just a decade ago, in the early 2010s, taking photos for the protection of artworks in museums was prohibited.

During the pandemic, the unique spatiality and singularity of museums extended and transformed to allow exhibitions to be viewed online, transcending physical walls. Consequently, there was a need to reassess the role of museums. Personally, I believe it's necessary to reconsider not just museum spaces but also the very concept of exhibiting artworks within spaces</p>
