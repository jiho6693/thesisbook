      <div class="box"><p>1. Physical works desire a digital body.

The forms of art are diverse, ranging from traditional media such as painting, drawing, and sculpture, to forms like prints, photographs, videos, web-based works, data, installations, or architectural structures. Art can even exist in forms that are not physical, such as performances, language, or thoughts. Depending on the form a work takes, some persist indefinitely, while others exist only briefly for a few individuals. Some may exist momentarily but continue to exist as they circulate through people's mouths, sometimes transforming into different forms of existence.

Artworks are desired to persist in any way possible, which is why they are transformed. They become a more useful form and are shared to remember the appearance of the work, to show it to those who haven't seen it in person, or to secure funding. Digitization serves as the most useful method for this purpose.  Particularly for forms like performances that don't have a fixed physical presence, transforming them in digital media is crucial. After exhibitions or events, efforts are made to document them as much as possible, often in the form of videos or photographs. Sometimes, nothing remains except for photographs. I feel like the final form of the artwork might be a JPEG.

The body that constitutes physical works is made up of various materials, requiring artists to study materials extensively, particularly in traditional media. They study primarily which materials or methods can sustain a work of art for a long time. As time passes, artworks naturally deteriorate and lose their form, making the durability of materials essential for maintaining the artwork's shape. However, artists typically do not create works with the assumption that artworks will last for centuries. Most works are deconstructed by the artist's hands before the materials reach the end of their lifespan. For young writers, determining whether it is worth maintaining the form of their work is more important than the material itself.

Artworks are not human, but they exist within human values and systems. Physical works, in particular, face real-world values and institutions as they exist within physical spaces, requiring space and incurring costs accordingly. They’re constantly evaluated as to whether they can maintain their form and whether they have the worth to occupy a certain space. If an artwork has a survival instinct, it might prefer to extend its life more comfortably through a digital body and space. This would be more efficient for the work, and beneficial for the artist.

      2. Digital Space

During the COVID-19 period when physical contact became impossible, we embraced the digital space as an alternative to physical spaces, not only for face-to-face interactions between people but also for interactions between people and artworks.

However, the approach most art institutions such as museums and galleries chose was to install exhibitions and scan the entire space to render them in the digital realm. These digital exhibitions were rendered with high-resolution images and state-of-the-art technology, making them appear objective and neutral. 

While these digital exhibitions had no constraints of time and space, viewers could only click to navigate and view the exhibitions at designated points in time. The movements of the viewers were perfectly controlled, and accordingly, the viewpoints and images of the artworks were uniformly controlled. Models implemented like in Figure 1 resulted in strange "dollhouses"(there is actually a View Dollhouse mode) where the outer walls disappeared, leaving only the inner walls and artworks. Exhibitions scanned and rendered in 3D space were as silent and lifeless. with no one alive within. The space and the artworks within were literally preserved and specimenized.

  Digital space is a virtual environment where digital systems, networks, servers, databases, etc. However, it is based on real physical structures(Figure 2) such as servers, data centers, and internet infrastructure. This physical structure supports and operates digital services and environments. Similar to purchasing real space in cubic meters or square feet, one should purchase digital space in bytes. Digital space prices are generally more affordable than acquiring or maintaining physical space. However, digital space has its limitations and is not infinitely abundant. What forms do works take in digital spaces? And what values and systems are involved in that process?

      Digital Body - Compression Format

Physical artworks are digitized to enter the digital space. Digitization refers to the process of converting artworks into a format usable on computers or digital devices. To digitize, artworks are photographed or scanned with high-resolution cameras, converting them into digital images. These digital images are then transformed into data using binary code, consisting of 0s and 1s, so that computers can understand them. This data is stored in a specific file format for compatibility with systems. Representative formats include mp4 for videos and jpeg for images. The format of an image file is associated with its size. Due to the high capacity of digital images, digital files are often compressed, and compression methods can be categorized as lossless or lossy.

The reason I am interested in image compression methods is that they align with the values of past growth strategies in Korea. In particular, the method of lossy compression prioritizes efficiency, aiming to represent images in high quality while reducing file size. In other words, it aims to efficiently represent and manage elements within limited resources and space, similar to past approaches in Korea.

A prominent format for lossy compression is JPEG. Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) was invented in 1986 and is widely used as a standard algorithm for digital image compression and encoding. It allows high-quality images to be stored in relatively small file sizes. JPEG compression involves color transformation, sampling, quantization, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT), and Huffman encoding. Through DCT, the program transforms images into the frequency domain using numerous 8x8 matrices (Figure 1). This DCT transformation compresses and represents the image data. JPEG is effective for photo and graphic image processing, particularly for easily sharing and storing images on the web. It boasts compatibility with existing systems and provides smooth support in standardized environments.

      Contemporary Structure - Display

      After obtaining a digital format, the data file transforms into an image when displayed through a medium like a digital display. Displays are based on pixels, the basic units of digital images. While traditionally thought of as small squares, pixels are more like point samples without dimension. The term "pixel" has evolved as technology has advanced. Some displays use subpixels to mix colors and provide higher resolutions. Despite advancements, the term "pixel" generally refers to the basic unit of an image, though its meaning can vary depending on specific technologies and contexts.
      
      Pixels come together to form an image, and the image is displayed through a medium. The display serves as a mediator, presenting the image in a physical form. Traditionally, screens have rectangular shapes and act as windows to another space within our environment. They filter, select, replace, and treat everything outside their frames. This phenomenon evolved with the advent of smaller screens like TVs and computer monitors. The computer screen, developed for military purposes, efficiently processed and displayed information collected by radar. Modern computer screens show multiple coexisting windows instead of a single image. Recently, with the invention of VR technology, screens seem to disappear entirely. Eventually, the retina and screen may merge into one. However, we still live in a society of screens, and both computer and TV monitors have become larger and flatter. Ultimately, screens may become as large as walls.
