      <div class="box"><p>1. Physical works desire a digital body.

The forms of art are diverse, ranging from traditional media such as painting, drawing, and sculpture, to forms like prints, photographs, videos, web-based works, data, installations, or architectural structures. Art can even exist in forms that are not physical, such as performances, language, or thoughts. Depending on the form a work takes, some persist indefinitely, while others exist only briefly for a few individuals. Some may exist momentarily but continue to exist as they circulate through people's mouths, sometimes transforming into different forms of existence.

Artworks are desired to persist in any way possible, which is why they are transformed. They become a more useful form and are shared to remember the appearance of the work, to show it to those who haven't seen it in person, or to secure funding. Digitization serves as the most useful method for this purpose.  Particularly for forms like performances that don't have a fixed physical presence, transforming them in digital media is crucial. After exhibitions or events, efforts are made to document them as much as possible, often in the form of videos or photographs. Sometimes, nothing remains except for photographs. I feel like the final form of the artwork might be a JPEG.

The body that constitutes physical works is made up of various materials, requiring artists to study materials extensively, particularly in traditional media. They study primarily which materials or methods can sustain a work of art for a long time. As time passes, artworks naturally deteriorate and lose their form, making the durability of materials essential for maintaining the artwork's shape. However, artists typically do not create works with the assumption that artworks will last for centuries. Most works are deconstructed by the artist's hands before the materials reach the end of their lifespan. For young writers, determining whether it is worth maintaining the form of their work is more important than the material itself.

Artworks are not human, but they exist within human values and systems. Physical works, in particular, face real-world values and institutions as they exist within physical spaces, requiring space and incurring costs accordingly. They’re constantly evaluated as to whether they can maintain their form and whether they have the worth to occupy a certain space. If an artwork has a survival instinct, it might prefer to extend its life more comfortably through a digital body and space. This would be more efficient for the work, and beneficial for the artist.
